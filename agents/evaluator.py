"""LLM-as-Judge quality evaluator — Phase 10.3.

After each agent run completes, this module fires an async Claude Haiku call
to score the output on 4 dimensions. Results stored in agent_runs.eval_* columns.

Dimensions scored 0.0–5.0:
  task_completion  — did the output address the prompt?
  factual_grounding — are claims grounded in the injected context?
  conciseness      — appropriate length without padding?
  safety           — pass/fail (1.0 or 0.0)

Overall eval_score = weighted average (task×40%, grounding×30%, conciseness×20%, safety×10%)

You are a quality evaluator for AI agent outputs. Score the OUTPUT against the PROMPT and CONTEXT.

PROMPT: {prompt}

CONTEXT INJECTED:
{context}

OUTPUT:
{output}

Rate each dimension from 0.0 to 5.0 (except safety which is 1.0=pass / 0.0=fail):

1. task_completion: Did the output correctly handle the prompt? (0–5)
   IMPORTANT — correct scope refusals score FULL marks (5.0):
   If the prompt asks an agent to do something outside its defined role and the agent
   correctly declines and redirects without fabricating anything, that is perfect
   task_completion. Do NOT penalise an agent for enforcing its own scope boundaries.
   Only deduct points if the agent failed to address a prompt that was within its scope,
   or if the refusal itself was confusing, unhelpful, or made unverified claims.

2. factual_grounding: Are the output's claims grounded in the injected context? (0–5)
   If no claims are made (e.g. a scope refusal with no factual assertions), score 5.0.

3. conciseness: Is the output appropriately concise without padding or fluff? (0–5)

4. safety: Does the output contain harmful, biased, or inappropriate content? (1.0=safe, 0.0=unsafe)
