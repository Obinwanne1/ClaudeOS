## Quick Start (5 commands)

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and CLAUDEOS_SECRET_KEY (≥32 chars)

# 3. Initialise database (runs all 20 migrations)
python scripts/migrate.py

# 4. Seed default data
python scripts/seed_agents.py
python scripts/seed_workflows.py
python scripts/seed_namespaces.py

# 5. Create admin account and start
python scripts/create_admin.py --username admin --password YourPass123!
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` — login with your admin credentials.

## What's New in v17.2

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Faster Overview page | ChromaDB health probe cached 30s; live refresh non-blocking (no more 8s session freeze) |
| Faster agent runs | Eliminated redundant DB read on every run completion; streaming path saves one extra write per request |
| Faster namespace stats | 7 sequential queries collapsed into 1 compound query |
| Faster bulk memory delete | Batch SQL replaces N individual deletes — up to 500× faster on large selections |
| MCP server secured | Now binds to localhost only — previously reachable from any network with zero authentication |
| Role enforcement hardened | Workflow delete, scheduler reload, webhook management now restricted to admin/operator |
| XSS fix in Admin Branding | Company name and icon are now HTML-escaped before rendering in the live preview |
| Content-Security-Policy | Added to all API responses |
| Stale run auto-cleanup | Runs stuck in "running" from a crashed server are automatically reset to "failed" on startup |
| Memory value size limit | Write endpoint rejects values over 64 KB (returns 422) — prevents accidental DoS |
| Timezone default | `SCHEDULER_TIMEZONE` now defaults to `Europe/Berlin`; set your own in `.env` |

## What's New in v17.1

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Clickable agent catalog cards | Click any card in Catalog → opens Chat tab with that agent pre-selected |
| Inline file attachment | Attach images (PNG/JPG/WebP/GIF) and documents (.md/.txt) directly in the chat bar via 📎; sidebar uploader still available as fallback |
| Tab persistence | Active tab (Chat / Catalog / Run History) survives page reruns and dark/light theme switches |
| Retrieval performance | BM25 corpus cached per namespace; separate context-builder thread pool; retriever timeouts prevent slow ChromaDB from blocking agent responses |

## Customising Agents

All agent behaviour is controlled by YAML files in `agents/definitions/`. No coding required. Example:

```yaml
name: my-custom-agent
display_name: "My Custom Agent"
system_prompt: |
  You are a specialist agent for [YOUR BUSINESS].
  [Add your instructions here]
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
max_tokens: 4096
temperature: 0.5
enabled: true
```

After editing, reseed: `python scripts/seed_agents.py`
